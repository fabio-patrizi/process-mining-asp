@incollection{declarative,
    abstract = {Management of dynamic processes in an important issue in rapidly changing organizations. Workflow management systems are systems that use detailed process models to drive the business processes. Current business process modelling languages and models are of imperative nature â€“ they strictly prescribe how to work. Systems that allow users to maneuver within the process model or even change the model while working are considered to be the most suitable for dynamic processes management. However, in many companies it is not realistic to expect that end-users are able to change their processes. Moreover, the imperative nature of these languages forces designer to over-specify processes, which results in frequent changes. We propose a fundamental paradigm shift for flexible process management and propose a more declarative approach. Declarative models specify what should be done without specifying how it should be done. We propose the ConDec language for modelling and enacting dynamic business processes. ConDec is based on temporal logic rather than some imperative process modelling language. Keywords: Workflow management, declarative model specification, dynamic workflow, flexibility, temporal logic.},

    abstract = {Traditional workflow management systems (WFMSs) are not flexible enough to support loosely-structured processes. Furthermore, flexibility in contemporary WFMSs usually comes at a certain cost, such as lack of support for users, lack of methods for model analysis, lack of methods for analysis of past executions, etc. DECLARE is a proto-type of a WFMS that uses a constraint-based process modeling language for the development of declarative models describing loosely-structured processes. In this paper we show how DECLARE can support loosely-structured processes without sacrificing important WFMSs features like user support, model verification, analysis of past executions, changing models at run-time, etc.},

While vacuity detection is effective, it is a relatively expensive technique requiring many additional model-checking runs. We address the problem of efficient vacuity detection for Bounded Model Checking (BMC) of linear temporal logic properties, presenting three partial vacuity detection methods based on the efficient analysis of the resolution proof produced by a successful BMC run. In particular, we define a characteristic of resolution proofsâ€” peripheralityâ€”and prove that if a variable is a source of vacuity, then there exists a resolution proof in which this variable is peripheral. Our vacuity detection tool, VaqTree, uses these methods to detect vacuous variables, decreasing the total number of model-checking runs required to detect all sources of vacuity.}},

	Abstract = {Contemporary workflow management systems are driven by explicit process
	models, i.e., a completely specified workflow design is required
	in order to enact a given workflow process. Creating a workflow design
	is a complicated time-consuming process and, typically, there are
	discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the processes
	as perceived by the management. Therefore, we have developed techniques
	for discovering workflow models. The starting point for such techniques
	is a so-called "workflow log" containing information about the workflow
	process as it is actually being executed. We present a new algorithm
	to extract a process model from such a log and represent it in terms
	of a Petri net. However, we also demonstrate that it is not possible
	to discover arbitrary workflow processes. We explore a class of workflow
	processes that can be discovered. We show that the /spl alpha/-algorithm
	can successfully mine any workflow represented by a so-called SWF-net.},

	Abstract = {The topic of process mining has attracted the attention of both researchers
	and tool vendors in the Business Process Management (BPM) space.
	The goal of process mining is to discover process models from event
	logs, i.e., events logged by some information system are used to
	extract information about activities and their causal relations.
	Several algorithms have been proposed for process mining. Many of
	these algorithms cannot deal with concurrency. Other typical problems
	are the presence of duplicate activities, hidden activities, non-free-choice
	constructs, etc. In addition, real-life logs contain noise (e.g.,
	exceptions or incorrectly logged events) and are typically incomplete
	(i.e., the event logs contain only a fragment of all possible behaviors).
	To tackle these problems we propose a completely new approach based
	on genetic algorithms. As can be expected, a genetic approach is
	able to deal with noise and incompleteness. However, it is not easy
	to represent processes properly in a genetic setting. In this paper,
	we show a genetic process mining approach using the so-called causal
	matrix as a representation for individuals. We elaborate on the relation
	between Petri nets and this representation and show that genetic
	algorithms can be used to discover Petri net models from event logs.
	Keywords: Process Mining, Petri Nets, Genetic Algorithms, Process
	Discovery, Business Process Intelligence, Business Activity Monitoring.},

	models from information system event logs. Such event logs often
	contain positive examples only. Without negative examples, it is
	a challenge to strike the right balance between recall and specificity,
	and to deal with problems such as expressiveness, noise, incomplete
	event logs, or the inclusion of prior knowledge. In this paper, we
	present a configurable technique that deals with these challenges
	by representing process discovery as a multi-relational classification
	problem on event logs supplemented with Artificially Generated Negative
	Events (AGNEs). This problem formulation allows using learning algorithms
	and evaluation techniques that are well-know in the machine learning
	community. Moreover, it allows users to have a declarative control

	Abstract = {<b>This International Student Edition is not for sale in the U.S.
	and Canada</b><br /> <br /> <br /> This new edition of <i>The Art
	of Prolog</i> contains a number of important changes. Most background
	sections at the end of each chapter have been updated to take account
	of important recent research results, the references have been greatly
	expanded, and more advanced exercises have been added which have
	been used successfully in teaching the course.<br /> <br /> Part
	II, The Prolog Language, has been modified to be compatible with
	the new Prolog standard, and the chapter on program development has
	been significantly altered: the predicates defined have been moved
	to more appropriate chapters, the section on efficiency has been
	moved to the considerably expanded chapter on cuts and negation,
	and a new section has been added on stepwise enhancement -- a systematic
	way of constructing Prolog programs developed by Leon Sterling.<br
	/> <br /> All but one of the chapters in Part III, Advanced Prolog
	Programming Techniques, have been substantially changed, with some
	major rearrangements. A new chapter on interpreters describes a rule
	language and interpreter for expert systems, which better illustrates
	how Prolog should be used to construct expert systems. The chapter
	on program transformation is completely new and the chapter on logic
	grammars adds new material for recognizing simple languages, showing
	how grammars apply to more computer science examples.},

	Abstract = {Contemporary workflow management systems are driven by explicit process
	models, i.e., a completely specified workflow design is required
	in order to enact a given workflow process. Creating a workflow design
	is a complicated time-consuming process and typically, there are
	discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the processes
	as perceived by the management. Therefore, we propose a technique
	for rediscovering workflow models. This technique uses workflow logs
	to discover the workflow process as it is actually being executed.
	The workflow log contains information about events taking place.
	We assume that these events are totally ordered and each event refers
	to one task being executed for a single case. This information can
	easily be extracted from transactional information systems (e.g.,
	Enterprise Resource Planning systems such as SAP and Baan). The rediscovering
	technique proposed in this paper can deal with noise and can also
	be used to validate workflow processes by uncovering and measuring
	the discrepancies between prescriptive models and actual process
	executions.},
