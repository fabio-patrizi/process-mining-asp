        abstract = {In the light of an increasing demand on business process
compliance, the verication of process models against compliance rules has become essential in enterprise computing. To be broadly applicable compliance checking has to support data-aware compliance rules as well as to consider data conditions within a process model. Independently of the actual technique applied to accomplish compliance checking, dataawareness means that in addition to the control ow dimension, the data dimension has to be explored during compliance checking. However, naive exploration of the data dimension can lead to state explosion. We address this issue by introducing an abstraction approach in this paper. We show how state explosion can be avoided by conducting compliance
checking for an abstract process model and abstract compliance rules.
Our abstraction approach can serve as preprocessing step to the actual
compliance checking and provides the basis for more ecient application
of existing compliance checking algorithms.}

	Abstract = {The management of business processes has recently received a lot of attention. One of the most interesting problems is the description of a process model in a language that allows the checking of the compliance of a process execution (or trace) to the model. In this paper we propose a language  for the representation of process models that is inspired to the SCIFF language and is an extension of clausal logic.
A process model is represented in the language as a set of integrity constraints that allow conjunctive formulas as disjuncts in the head.
We present an approach for inducing these models from data: we define a subsumption relation for the integrity constraints, we define a refinement operator and we adapt the algorithm ICL to the problem of learning such formulas. The system has been applied to the problem of inducing the model of a sealed bid auction and of the NetBill protocol. The data used for learning and testing were randomly generated from correct models of the processes.},

        abstract = {In the light of an increasing demand on business process
compliance, the verication of process models against compliance rules has become essential in enterprise computing. To be broadly applicable compliance checking has to support data-aware compliance rules as well as to consider data conditions within a process model. Independently of the actual technique applied to accomplish compliance checking, dataawareness means that in addition to the control ow dimension, the data dimension has to be explored during compliance checking. However, naive exploration of the data dimension can lead to state explosion. We address this issue by introducing an abstraction approach in this paper. We show how state explosion can be avoided by conducting compliance
checking for an abstract process model and abstract compliance rules.
Our abstraction approach can serve as preprocessing step to the actual
compliance checking and provides the basis for more ecient application
of existing compliance checking algorithms.}

  abstract = {Dijsktra's calculus of guarded commands can be generalized and simplified
	by dropping the law of the excluded miracle. This paper gives a self-contained
	account of the generalized calculus from first principles through
	the semantics of recursion. The treatment of recursion uses the fixpoint
	method from denotational semantics. The paper relies only on the
	algebraic properties of predicates; individual states are not mentioned
	(except for motivation). To achieve this, we apply the correspondence
	between programs and predicates that underlies predicative programming.
	The paper is written from the axiomatic semantic point of view, but
	its contents can be described from the denotational semantic point
	of view roughly as follows: The Plotkin-Apt correspondence between
	wp semantics and the Smyth powerdomain is extended to a correspondence
	between the full wp/wlp semantics and the Plotkin powerdomain extended
	with the empty set.},
