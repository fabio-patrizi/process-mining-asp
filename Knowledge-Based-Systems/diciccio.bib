  Abstract                 = {Embedded systems are specialized computers used in larger systems or machines to control equipments such as automobiles, home appliances, communication, control and office machines. Such pervasivity is particularly evident in immersive realities, i.e., scenarios in which invisible embedded systems need to continuously interact with human users, in order to provide continuous sensed information and to react to service requests from the users themselves. The SM4All project investigates an innovative middleware platform for inter-working of smart embedded services in immersive and person-centric environments, through the use of composability and semantic techniques for dynamic service reconfiguration. This is applied to the challenging scenario of private houses and home-care assistance in presence of users with different abilities and needs (e.g., young, able-bodied, aged and disabled). This paper presentes a brief overview of the SM4All system architecture.},

Here, we consider a user process as specified in terms of repeated goals that the user may choose to get fulfilled, organized in a kind of routine. Available services are suitably composed and orchestrated in order to realize such a process. In particular we focus on smart homes, in which available services are those ones offered by sensor and actuator devices deployed in the home, and the target user process is directly and continuously controlled by the inhabitants, through actual goal choices. We provide a solver that synthesizes the orchestrator for the requested process and we show its practical applicability in a real smart home use case.},

  Abstract                 = {Process discovery is the task of generating models from event logs. Mining processes that operate in an environment of high variability is an ongoing research challenge because various algorithms tend to produce spaghetti-like models. This is particularly the case when procedural models are generated. A promising direction to tackle this challenge is the usage of declarative process modelling languages like Declare, which summarise complex behaviour in a compact set of behavioural constraints. However, Declare constraints with branching are expensive to be calculated.In addition, it is often the case that hundreds of branching Declare constraints are valid for the same log, thus making, again, the discovery results unreadable. In this paper, we address these problems from a theoretical angle. More specifically, we define the class of Target- Branched Declare constraints and investigate the formal properties it exhibits. Furthermore, we present a technique for the efficient discovery of compact Target-Branched Declare models. We discuss the merits of our work through an evaluation based on a prototypical implementation using both artificial and real-world event logs.},

Processes are defined knowledge-intensive when people/agents carry them out in a fair degree of ``uncertainty'', where the uncertainty depends on different factors, such as the high number of tasks to be represented, their unpredictable nature, or their dependency on the scenario. In the worst case, there is no predefined view of the knowledge-intensive process, and tasks are mainly discovered as the process unfolds. In this work, starting from three different real scenarios, we present a critical comparative analysis of the existing approaches used for supporting knowledge-intensive processes, and we discuss some recent research techniques that may complement or extend the existing state of the art.},

  Abstract                 = {Engineering of knowledge-intensive processes (KiPs) is far from being mastered, since they are genuinely knowledge- and data-centric, and require substantial flexibility, at both design- and run-time. In this work, starting from a scientific literature analysis in the area of KiPs and from three real-world domains and application scenarios, we provide a precise characterization of KiPs. Furthermore, we devise some general requirements related to KiPs management and execution. Such requirements contribute to the definition of an evaluation framework to assess current system support for KiPs. To this end, we present a critical analysis on a number of existing process-oriented approaches by discussing their efficacy against the requirements.},

  Abstract                 = {The declarative modeling of workflows has been introduced to cope with flexibility in processes. Its rationale is based on the idea of stating some basic rules (named constraints), tying the execution of some activities to the enabling, requiring or disabling of other activities. What is not explicitly prohibited by such constraints is implicitly considered legal, w.r.t. the specification of the process. Declarative models for workflows are based on a taxonomy of constraint templates. Constraints are thus instances of constraint templates, applied to specific activities. Many algorithms for the automated discovery of declarative workflows associate to each constraint a support. The support is a statistical measure assessing to what extent a constraint was respected during the enactment(s) of the process. In current state-of-the-art literature, constraints having a support below a user-defined threshold are considered not valid for the process. Thresholds are useful for filtering out guesses based on possible misleading events, reported in logs either because of errors in the execution, unlikely process deviations, or wrong recordings in logs. The latter circumstance can be considered extremely relevant when logs are not written down directly by machines reporting their work, but extracted from other source of information. Here, we present an insight on the actual capacity of filtering constraints by modifying the threshold for support, on the basis of real data. Then, taking a cue from the results performed on such analysis, we consider the trend of support when controlled errors are injected into the log, w.r.t. individual constraint templates. Through these tests, we demonstrate by experiment that each constraint template reveal to be less or more robust to different kinds of error, according to its nature.},

They are typically carried out by the ``knowledge workers'', such as professors, managers, researchers. They are often scarcely formalized or completely unknown a priori. Throughout this paper, we discuss how we addressed the challenge of discovering declarative control flows, in the context of artful processes. To this extent, we devised and implemented a two-phase algorithm, named MINERful. The first phase builds a knowledge base, where statistical information extracted from logs is represented. During the second phase, queries are evaluated on that knowledge base, in order to infer the constraints that constitute the discovered process. After an outline of the overall approach and an insight on the adopted process modeling language, we describe in detail our discovery technique. Thereupon, we analyze its performances, both from a theoretical and an experimental perspective. A user-driven evaluation of the quality of results is also reported, on the basis of a real case study. Finally, a study on the fitness of discovered models with respect to synthetic and real logs is presented.},

This paper describes MINERful++, a two-step algorithm for an efficient discovery of constraints that constitute declarative workflow models. As a first step, a knowledge base is built, with information about temporal statistics gathered from execution traces. Then, the statistical support of constraints is computed, by querying that knowledge base. MINERful++ is fast, modular, independent of the specific formalism adopted for representing constraints, based on a probabilistic approach and capable of eliminating the redundancy of subsumed constraints.},

The advantages are numerous: the unspecified agile processes that are autonomously used become formalized. Since such models are not defined a priori by experts but rather inferred from real-life scenarios that actually took place, they are guaranteed to respect the true executions (often Business Process Management tools are used to show the discrepancy between the supposed and the concrete workflows). Moreover, such models can be shared, compared, preserved, so that the best practices might be put in evidence from the community of knowledge workers, to the whole business benefit. Finally, an analysis over such processes can be done, so that bottlenecks and delays in actual executions can be found out. In MailOfMine, workflow models are described according to a declarative approach, with a specific visual notation. After presenting the architecture of the system, this paper reports some performance tests and the results of the application of the tool on a real case study.},
